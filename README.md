## Introduction
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I have been tasked with performing an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Context
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and theyâ€™re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.
